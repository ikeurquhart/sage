It is useful to know whether I should spend my marginal dollar paying off debt or building an emergency fund. Though more challenging, it is more useful to know whether I should spend my marginal time and energy paying off debt or improving my diet. It is impossible to determine the optimal thing to focus on, but it should be possible to determine those things that are definitely not worth spending time on e.g. sodium consumption is mostly a distraction from focusing on ultra-processed foods.
